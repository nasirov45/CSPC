Tests for the decay simulation.

One complete test is given as a model. Add the two tests described in the
lab handout (a negative-rate test, and a test against the analytical law).
Run with:  pytest -v

#   Check that calling simulate(...) with a negative lam raises a ValueError.
#   Which pytest tool checks that an error is raised?


# TODO 2: test_matches_law
#   Check that the simulation's AVERAGE over many seeds is close to the
#   physical law  N0 * exp(-lam * t).
#   Which pytest tool compares floating-point values with a tolerance?
